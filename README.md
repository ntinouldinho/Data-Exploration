# FEC-Data-Exploration
Explored and extracted data from the official FEC website which contains information on USA's political party incomes and transactions conserning the presidential election. 
Tools that were used are Jupyter Notebook for the presentation of my analysis. I mostly used Pandas amongst other Python libraries such as numpy and matplotlib.
